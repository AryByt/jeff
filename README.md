### Libraries and Dependencies

|     Library      | Description                                |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | _React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. _ |
|   React Router   | _Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model. React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!_ |
| React SemanticUI | _Semantic is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML._ |
